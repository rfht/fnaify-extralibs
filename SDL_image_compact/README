About SDL_image_compact
-----------------------
SDL_image_compact is simply a branch of SDL_image with a single commit to add
stb_image/tinyjpeg support. This is NOT intended to be a fork and will remain
compatible with SDL_image for as long as it exists. The intention is to have
these changes merged into mainline SDL_image, at which point this project will
be deleted.

The Mercurial patch can be found at 'hg_patch.diff', and the Bugzilla report can
be found here:

https://bugzilla.libsdl.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4249

This change makes building and shipping for mobile/console targets MUCH easier!

Dependencies
------------
While we are adding stb_image and tinyjpeg to this project, SDL_image_compact
still only depends solely on SDL2. SDL_image_compact never explicitly uses the C
runtime.

Building SDL_image_compact
--------------------------
For *nix platforms, just type `make` in the root directory!

For Windows, see the 'visualc/' directory. /* TODO: Not done yet! */

For Xbox One, see the 'visualc-winrt' directory.
